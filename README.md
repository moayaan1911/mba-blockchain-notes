# 🚀 MBA Learning Hub

This website was created using Next.js via Vibe Coding with Gemini. It's an interactive and intelligent learning platform designed to bring your MBA notes to life.

# 🎯 Purpose

The main purpose of this application is to transform static course notes into a dynamic, engaging, and AI-enhanced study tool. By organizing modules into interactive sections and enriching them with real-world examples, analogies, and external resources, the app aims to make complex business concepts easier to understand and retain. The integrated Gemini AI features, such as the "Explain Like I'm 5," case study generator, and quiz creator, provide a personalized and adaptive learning experience, helping you to test your knowledge and apply theoretical concepts to practical scenarios.
